description: pneumatosis coli in the cecum.
possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, copd, anemia with gastric ulcer.
(medical transcription sample report)

reason for consultation: pneumatosis coli in the cecum.

history of present illness: the patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted on 10/27/07 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia.
the patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.
in addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.
he had a ct scan on friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.
in discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.

past medical history: obtained from the medical chart.
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia.

medications: per his current medical chart.

allergies: no known drug allergies.

social history: the patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago.
he does have chronic alcohol use.

physical examination:

general: a very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment.
vital signs: afebrile. heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation.
respiratory rate is 17-20.
blood pressure 130s-150s/60s- 70s.
neck: soft and supple, full range of motion.
heart: regular. abdomen: distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information.
he does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.

diagnostics: a ct scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.

assessment: possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, copd, anemia with gastric ulcer.

plan: the patientappears to have pneumatosis froma ctscan2 days ago.
nothingwas done aboutitatthattime as the patientappeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and i would recommend getting a repeat ct scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.
the patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator verywellinhis currentstate. so we willlook atthe ctscanand make decisions based onthe findings as far as thatis concerned.

1. right orchiopexy.
2. right herniorrhaphy.

anesthesia: lma.

estimated blood loss: minimal.

specimen: sac.

brief history: this is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from craig connor at cottonwood with right undescended testis.
the patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.
the testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.
the testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.
the patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.
options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, hcg stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.
risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.
the patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.

procedure in detail: the patient was brought to the or, anesthesia was applied.
the patient was placed in supine position.
the patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.
after the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.
the incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.
the external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.
the ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.
after dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.
the testis was pulled up.
the cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried allthe wayup to the internalinguinalring. there was verysmallhernia, whichwas removed and was tied atthe base.
pds suture was used to tie this hernia sac allthe wayup to the base.
there was a yrightatthe vas and cord indicatingthere was enoughlengthinto the scrotalsac. the testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.
one centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a dartos pouch was created.
the testicle was broughtdowninto the pouchand was placed into the pouch.
carefulattentionwas done to ensure thatthere was no torsionofthe cord.
the vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.
the epididymis was in the posterolateral location.
the testicle was pexed using 4-0 vicryl into the scrotal sac.
skin was closed using 5-0 monocryl. the external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 pds. attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.
a small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.
marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 ml worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.
after closing the external oblique fascia, the scarpa was brought together using 4-0 vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 monocryl in subcuticular fashion.
dermabond and steri-strips were applied.

the patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.

please note that the testicle was viable.
it was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.
there were no palpable testicular masses.
plan was for the patientto followup withus inabout1 month.
the patientwas told notto do anyheavyliftingfor atleast3 months, okayto shower in48 hours.
no tub bath for 2 months.

the diamond keratome was used to make a vertical groove incision just inside the limbus at the 108-degree axis.
this incision was then shelved anteriorly and used to enter the anterior chamber.
the utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous circular capsulorrhexis after incision of the capsule with the cystotome. hydrodissection was performed.
the lens nucleus was removed using phacoemulsification and irrigation and aspiration.
lens cortex also was removed using irrigation and aspiration.
viscoelastic was placed to inflate the capsular remnant.
the diamond knife was used to enlarge the phaco incision.
intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations, placed in the injector system, and inserted into the capsule without difficulty.
the trailing haptic was placed using the sheets forceps and the barraquer sweep to push the iol optic posteriorly as the trailing haptic was placed.
the anterior cornea wound was sutured along with the paracentesis after irrigation and aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic from the anterior chamber.
